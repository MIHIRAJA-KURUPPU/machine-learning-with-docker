## Importance of Docker:

Isolation and Portability: Docker containers provide isolated environments that are portable across different systems, unlike virtual environments (e.g., Conda, virtualenv) which lack easy replicability across machines.

Reproducibility: Ensures consistent output, critical for ML experiments and deployment.

## Docker vs Virtual Environments:

Virtual environments isolate dependencies within a single environment but are difficult to replicate across different systems, especially with OS or hardware differences. Docker provides a more robust solution for consistent and replicable environments.
